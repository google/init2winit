class VirtualBatchNorm(nn.Module):
  """VirtualBatchNorm Module. Normalizes the input using batch statistics.

  Forked from the original flax nn.BatchNorm layer, this allows users to have
  multiple virtual batches per device. For example, if the per-device batch size
  is 128 and the user specifies `virtual_batch_size=32`, each 1/4 of the batch
  will be normalized with statistics only from that 1/4. The running averages
  computed here are averaged at every step, which is equivalent to keeping
  separate running averages and then averaging them at the end of training. Note
  that users must still sync running averages across hosts before checkpointing,
  as is also done with nn.BatchNorm.

  Attributes:
    x: the input to be normalized.
    axis: the feature or non-batch axis of the input.
    momentum: decay rate for the exponential moving average of
      the batch statistics.
    epsilon: a small float added to variance to avoid dividing by zero.
    dtype: the dtype of the computation (default: float32).
    use_bias:  if True, bias (beta) is added.
    use_scale: if True, multiply by scale (gamma).
      When the next layer is linear (also e.g. nn.relu), this can be disabled
      since the scaling will be done by the next layer.
    bias_init: initializer for bias, by default, zero.
    scale_init: initializer for scale, by default, one.
    axis_name: the axis name used to combine batch statistics from multiple
      devices. See `jax.pmap` for a description of axis names (default: None).
    axis_index_groups: groups of axis indices within that named axis
      representing subsets of devices to reduce over (default: None). For
      example, `[[0, 1], [2, 3]]` would independently batch-normalize over the
      examples on the first two and last two devices. See `jax.lax.psum` for
      more details.
    batch_size: the batch size used for each forward pass. We must explicitly
      pass this instead of relying on `x.shape` because we may initialize the
      model with a batch of zeros with a different batch size.
    virtual_batch_size: the size of the virtual batches to construct on
      each device, which will be used to normalize sub-batches of each
      per-device batch. Must evenly divide the per-device batch size (as
      determined by `x`), and cannot be combined with `axis_index_groups`.
      Passing the default value of None will replicate the existing nn.BatchNorm
      behavior without virtual batches.
    total_batch_size: only necessary when using gradient accumulation, the total
      batch size used to calculate accumulated gradients. This is required here
      because we need to store `total_batch_size // virtual_batch_size` EMAs
      instead of just `x.shape[batch_axis] // virtual_batch_size`.
    data_format: only used when `virtual_batch_size` is set, to determine the
      batch axis.
