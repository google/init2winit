  """Defines commonalities between all models.

  A model is class with five members variables and five member functions.

  Member variables: hps, dataset_meta_data, loss_fn, output_activation_fn,
  metrics_bundle

  hps is a set of hyperpameters in this experiment.
  dataset_meta_data is a set of data that describes the dataset.
  loss_fn is a loss function.
  output_activation_fn is an activation function at the output layer.
  metrics_bundle is a dict mapping metric names to corresponding functions.

  Member functions: __init__, evaluate_batch, predict_batch, training_cost,
  build_flax_module

  __init__ takes hps, dataset_meta_data, loss_name, metrics_name as arguments
  and set them to corresponding member variables. This function uses
  losses.get_loss_fn, losses.output_activation_fn and metrics.get_metrics
  to obtain loss_fn, output_activation_fn, and metrics_bundle
  from loss_name and metrics_name as:

    self.loss_fn = losses.get_loss_fn(loss_name)
    self.output_activation_fn = losses.get_output_activation_fn(loss_name)
    self.metrics_bundle = metrics.get_metrics(metrics_name)

  evaluate_batch compute metrics in self.metrics_bundle for a given batch.
  A dictionary having summed metrics is returned.

  predict_batch computes the logits of a given batch using a given flax_module.
  This function is primarily used in inference_lib.

  training_cost defines a loss with weight decay, where the
  weight decay factor is determined by hps.l2_decay_factor.

  flax_module_def is returned from the build_flax_module function. A typical
  usage pattern will be:

    model, hps = model_lib.get_model('fully_connected')
    ...  # possibly modify the default hps.
    model = model(hps, dataset.meta_data)
