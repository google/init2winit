### WMT

See the various WMT translation datasets in TFDS, e.g.
[WMT15](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/wmt15_translate).
As of early 2021, <http://www.statmt.org/wmt20/> should also have a lot of
relevant information and links to the workshops for different years.

### fastMRI

Information and access information are available at
[fastMRI](https://fastmri.org/)'s webpage. Of note, the data input pipeline
we replicate consists of the knee single-coil challenge only.
