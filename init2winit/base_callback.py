"""Infrastructure for arbitrary code to be run during training.

Callbacks can be stateful, and in trainer are meant to be called as follows:


  callback_builder = callbacks.get_callback(config['callback_name'])
  callback = callback_builder(optimizer, dataset, hps, config, train_dir)

  callback_metrics = callback.run_eval(optimizer, batch_stats, global_step).

We require that the config has a field 'callback_name', which the trainer
uses to determine which callbacks to run. The dictionary, callback_metrics
should be scalar valued, and will be automatically added to the existing trainer
scalar metrics.
