  """Paterson-Stockmeyer evaluation of a[0] x + a[1] x² + ... + a[n-1] xⁿ.

  A variant of the Paterson-Stockmeyer method for polynomial evaluation
  presented in [2], which avoids using the multiplicative identity (x⁰). The
  algorithm uses only ⌈2√n⌉ - 2 multiplications instead of n - 1, making it
  especially suitable when multiplications are expensive, e.g., for matrices.
  The reduced number of multiplications is accomplished by grouping the terms as

          (a[0]  x +    a[1] x² + ... + a[ s-1] xˢ) +
     xˢ   (a[s]  x +  a[s+1] x² + ... + a[2s-1] xˢ) +
    (xˢ)² (a[2s] x + a[2s+1] x² + ... + a[3s-1] xˢ) +
            ...

  with s = ⌈√n⌉. The powers up to xˢ are precomputed with s - 1 multiplications,
  allowing all the (at most) degree s polynomials in parentheses above to be
  evaluated. These are then combined using Horner's rule with ⌈n/s⌉ - 1
  subsequent multiplications.
